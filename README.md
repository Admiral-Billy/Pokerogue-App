# Pokerogue App
 An app to play Pokerogue.net in an app window. Wow!

All cookie-related information can be found in %AppData%/Pokerogue; go there and delete the whole thing if you want the game to forget your login/settings/etc.


Build instructions:

Install NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en)

Open a command prompt to the directory you stick this repo in

Install electron (npm install electron --save-dev) and the electron packager (npm install electron-packager --save-dev)

Run from command prompt with "npm start" or build the full app with "npm run package".

Play! The app is found in dist/Pokerogue/Pokerogue.exe if you built it that way.
