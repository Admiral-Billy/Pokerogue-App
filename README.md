# Pokerogue App
 An app to play Pokerogue.net in an app window. Wow!

Build instructions:

Install NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en)

Open a command prompt to the directory you stick this repo in

Install electron (npm install electron --save-dev) and the electron packager (npm install electron-packager --save-dev)

Run from command prompt with "npm start" or build the full app with "npm run package".

Play! The app is found in dist/Pokerogue/Pokerogue.exe if you built it that way.
